    <h2>EV Charging Equipment Categories:</h2>
    <p>EV charging equipment is categorized by charging speed, which depends on the battery's depletion level, capacity, type, vehicle's charger capacity, and charging equipment specifications. Charging duration can range from under 20 minutes with DC fast chargers to over 20 hours with Level 1 chargers. Selecting equipment involves considering several factors like networking, payment options, and maintenance.</p>
    
<div class="charging-category">
    <h3>Level 1 Charging</h3>
    <p>Offers about 5 miles of range per hour of charging using a 120V AC plug. Comes standard with EVs, connecting via a NEMA connector to a household outlet and an SAE J1772 connector to the vehicle. It's a common home charging option, providing about 40 miles of range for an 8-hour charge. Less than 1% of U.S. public charging ports are Level 1.</p>
    </div>

<div class="charging-category">
    <h3>Level 2 Charging</h3>
    <p>Provides roughly 25 miles of range per hour of charging, using either 240V (residential) or 208V (commercial) power. It's a frequent choice for home, public, and workplace charging, offering faster charging speeds. Most U.S. public EV charging ports are Level 2.</p>
    </div>

<div class="charging-category">
    <h3>DC Fast Charging</h3>
    <p>Offers 100 to 200+ miles of range per 30 minutes of charging. It's crucial for quick charging along busy routes and is expanding due to federal initiatives and fleet adoption. There are three main types of DC fast chargers: CCS, CHAdeMO, and J3400 (NACS).</p>

st.markdown("<p style='font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-color: white;'>Utilities are responsible for supplying power and maintaining the infrastructure needed for essential services, giving consumers access to electricity, natural gas, water, and more. With the rising popularity of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), electric utilities are becoming more pivotal in supporting PEV adoption by expanding charging infrastructure and ensuring there is enough power available. They offer various incentives to residential, commercial, and multi-unit dwellings to encourage the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles and the installation of electric vehicle charging stations. These incentives can include reduced rates for electricity usage during off-peak hours, cash-back rebates, grants, loans, and other support services for PEVs and their charging equipment. These efforts not only motivate customers to embrace new and alternative technologies but also enhance customer involvement and contribute to the sustainable increase in energy demand.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
